# You Should Know
- The default key bind to open the menu is **G**
- This mod is still in beta - it should mostly be stable, though I fully expect minor bugs to still exist. Please report them so that I may squash them!
- Modpack developers - **you may add this mod to your modpack** without asking - though please keep in mind that this mod is in beta and will likely interfere with other mods that add music to the game!

<details>
<summary>Other info</summary>

• Before anyone asks, a Forge version will be considered if enough interest is shown

• This mod works by replacing Minecraft's entire music logic. This allows for complete control over how, when, and what music plays. However, this breaks the ability for other mods to add music to the game. This will be fixed in the future, but please do still report any mods that this mod breaks!

• I will try to push out updates as much as possible, forgive me if I'm a little slow! I've got quite a bit goin' on

Currently available for Fabric and Quilt on 1.19.2, requires the Fabric API (or QFAPI for Quilt)
Feel free to ask any questions in the GitHub if you are unsure about something in the mod!

**Enjoy!**
