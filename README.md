## Update:
I am currently working on a full re-write for this mod. Maintaining this mod in it's current state is a bit difficult, as it was my first ever Minecraft mod and I have learnt a lot since then. A lot of work has been going into a custom UI library (that will be available as it's own library mod). I'm glad to report that it's mostly done, and is genuinely a really cool tool to work with. UI has been one of the pain points with Playlist, since the mod is so UI-heavy. Playlist 2.0 will see a completetly new UI, built-in support for custom songs, and will also contain features that may help modpack developers (since it's a surprsingly large use case!).

As such, I am no longer addressing any of the current issues, since the new mod will be a clean slate anyway.

Additionally, I also fully plan on open sourcing Playlist 2.0, creating a wiki here, and recording a video tutorial series to help people learn how to use all the features in Playlist :)

<details>
<summary>Other info</summary>

• Before anyone asks, a Forge version will be considered if enough interest is shown

• This mod works by replacing Minecraft's entire music logic. This allows for complete control over how, when, and what music plays. However, this breaks the ability for other mods to add music to the game. This will be fixed in the future, but please do still report any mods that this mod breaks!

• I will try to push out updates as much as possible, forgive me if I'm a little slow! I've got quite a bit goin' on

</details>

Currently available for Fabric, with the latest version supported being 1.20.1, and requires the Fabric API
Feel free to ask any questions in the GitHub if you are unsure about something in the mod!

**Enjoy!**
